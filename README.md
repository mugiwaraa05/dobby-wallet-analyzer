Dobby Wallet Analyzer
  
The Dobby Wallet Analyzer is a web application that analyzes Ethereum wallet addresses to generate a unique, AI-powered personality profile based on transaction data and token holdings. Powered by Moralis for blockchain data and Fireworks AI with the Dobby-70B model for witty persona descriptions, behavior patterns, and investment style insights, this app offers a fun and engaging way to explore crypto wallet behaviors.

A snarky one-sentence persona description.

Investment style insights based on transaction patterns.
